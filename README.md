mod-hw-duo
===========

This repository contains the schematics and PCB design files for the MOD Duo X Bottom board. 

The other 2 boards (controller board and coreboard adapter) are done in Altium and for that reason not available in this repository but in the MOD Production folder of the MOD Devices google drive. 

Please, use KiCAD 5 to edit the project.

The `master` branch has the most recent version of the bottom-board project, made for the Duo X. 

The `rev_20161129-updated` branch has the legacy production version of the MOD Duo boards.
